	 * X.right. So, if we want to find X.successor(), we do the following:
	 * 
	 * 1. If X has a right child, then the successor must be on the right side
	 * of X (because of the order in which we visit nodes). Specifically, the
	 * left-most child must be the first node visited in that subtree.
	 * 
	 * 2. Else， we go to X 's parent (call it P).
	 * 
	 * 2.a. If X was a left child (P.left = X), then P is the successor of X
	 * 
	 * 2.b. If X was a right child (P.right = X), then we have fully visited P,
	 * so we call successor(P).
