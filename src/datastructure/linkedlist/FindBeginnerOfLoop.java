/*
 * Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop.
DEFINITION
Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node’s next pointer points to an
earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
EXAMPLE
Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
Output: C

	 * If we move two pointers, one with speed 1 and another with speed 2, they
	 * will end up meeting if the linked list has a loop. Why? Think about two
	 * cars driving on a track—the faster car will always pass the slower one!
	 * The tricky part here is finding the start of the loop. Imagine, as an
	 * analogy, two people racing around a track, one running twice as fast as
	 * the other. If they start off at the same place, when will they next meet?
	 * They will next meet at the start of the next lap. Now, let’s suppose Fast
	 * Runner had a head start of k meters on an n step lap. When will they next
	 * meet? They will meet k meters before the start of the next lap. (Why?
	 * Fast Runner would have made k + 2(n - k) steps, including its head start,
	 * and Slow Runner would have made n - k steps. Both will be k steps before
	 * the start of the loop.) Now, going back to the problem, when Fast Runner
	 * (n2) and Slow Runner (n1) are moving around our circular linked list, n2
	 * will have a head start on the loop when n1 enters. Specially, it will
	 * have a head start of k, where k is the number of nodes before the loop.
	 * Since n2 has a head start of k nodes, n1 and n2 will meet k nodes before
	 * the start of the loop. So, we now know the following: 1. Head is k nodes
	 * from LoopStart (by definition). 2. MeetingPoint for n1 and n2 is k nodes
	 * from LoopStart (as shown above). Thus, if we move n1 back to Head and
	 * keep n2 at MeetingPoint, and move them both at the same pace, they will
	 * meet at LoopStart.
